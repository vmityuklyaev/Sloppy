# Visor Configuration

All Visor settings live under the `visor` key in your `sloppy.json` configuration file. Every setting has a sensible default, so you only need to add fields you want to change.

```json
{
  "visor": {
    "scheduler": {
      "enabled": true,
      "intervalSeconds": 300,
      "jitterSeconds": 60
    },
    "bootstrapBulletin": true,
    "bulletinMaxWords": 300,
    "model": null,
    "tickIntervalSeconds": 30,
    "workerTimeoutSeconds": 600,
    "branchTimeoutSeconds": 60,
    "maintenanceIntervalSeconds": 3600,
    "decayRatePerDay": 0.05,
    "pruneImportanceThreshold": 0.1,
    "pruneMinAgeDays": 30,
    "channelDegradedFailureCount": 3,
    "channelDegradedWindowSeconds": 600,
    "idleThresholdSeconds": 1800,
    "webhookURLs": [],
    "mergeEnabled": false,
    "mergeSimilarityThreshold": 0.80,
    "mergeMaxPerRun": 10
  }
}
```

## Bulletin scheduler

These settings control how often Visor generates periodic bulletins.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.scheduler.enabled` | `true` | Whether the periodic bulletin scheduler runs at all. Set to `false` to disable automatic bulletin generation; bulletins can still be generated on-demand. |
| `visor.scheduler.intervalSeconds` | `300` | How often (in seconds) the scheduler generates a new bulletin. Default is every 5 minutes. |
| `visor.scheduler.jitterSeconds` | `60` | A random amount of time (0 to this value) added to each interval. Prevents multiple instances from generating bulletins simultaneously. |

## Bulletin content

These settings control what goes into each bulletin and which model synthesizes it.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.bootstrapBulletin` | `true` | Whether to generate an initial bulletin when Sloppy starts. Ensures agents have context from the very first message. |
| `visor.bulletinMaxWords` | `300` | Target word count for the LLM-synthesized bulletin digest. The model is instructed to stay near this limit. |
| `visor.model` | `null` | The model to use for bulletin synthesis, in the format `"provider:model-id"` (for example `"openai:gpt-4o-mini"`). When `null`, the default system model is used. If no model is available at all, Visor falls back to a plain-text summary. |

## Supervision tick

The supervision tick loop is the heartbeat of Visor's health monitoring. It runs continuously in the background.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.tickIntervalSeconds` | `30` | How often (in seconds) the supervision loop runs. Each tick checks worker health, branch health, and channel signals. |
| `visor.workerTimeoutSeconds` | `600` | How long (in seconds) a worker may stay in a running or waiting state before Visor publishes a timeout event. Default is 10 minutes. Increase this for workers that legitimately take a long time. |
| `visor.branchTimeoutSeconds` | `60` | How long (in seconds) a branch may stay active before Visor force-concludes it. Branches are short-lived by design; keep this low. |

## Memory maintenance

Visor runs memory maintenance (decay, pruning, and optional merge) on a schedule separate from the supervision tick.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.maintenanceIntervalSeconds` | `3600` | How often (in seconds) the maintenance pass runs. Default is once per hour. |
| `visor.decayRatePerDay` | `0.05` | The fraction of importance lost each day for non-identity memories. At 0.05, a memory at importance 1.0 will be at roughly 0.6 after 10 days. Set to `0` to disable decay. |
| `visor.pruneImportanceThreshold` | `0.1` | Memories with importance below this value become candidates for pruning. Only memories that also meet the minimum age requirement are actually removed. |
| `visor.pruneMinAgeDays` | `30` | A memory must be at least this many days old to be pruned, even if its importance is below the threshold. Protects recently created memories from early removal. |

## Channel health signals

These settings control when Visor decides that a channel is experiencing problems.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.channelDegradedFailureCount` | `3` | The number of worker failures that must occur in one channel within the time window to trigger a "channel degraded" signal. |
| `visor.channelDegradedWindowSeconds` | `600` | The sliding time window (in seconds) used to count worker failures. Default is 10 minutes. Failures older than this window do not count. |

## Idle detection

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.idleThresholdSeconds` | `1800` | How many seconds of inactivity (no incoming messages) must pass before Visor emits an idle signal. Default is 30 minutes. |

## Webhooks

Visor can notify external systems when signals fire. Each URL receives an HTTP POST with the event payload in JSON.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.webhookURLs` | `[]` | A list of URLs to call when any `visor.signal.*` event fires (`visor.signal.channel_degraded` or `visor.signal.idle`). |

Example:

```json
{
  "visor": {
    "webhookURLs": [
      "https://hooks.example.com/sloppy-alerts"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Memory merge

Memory merge is an optional feature that consolidates similar memories over time. It is disabled by default because it requires a capable embedding or recall backend to work well.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visor.mergeEnabled` | `false` | Whether the merge pass runs during maintenance. |
| `visor.mergeSimilarityThreshold` | `0.80` | The minimum recall similarity score (0 to 1) required to consider two memories as candidates for merging. Higher values mean only very close matches are merged. |
| `visor.mergeMaxPerRun` | `10` | The maximum number of merge operations performed in a single maintenance pass. Caps the amount of work done at once. |

Only memories that are at least 1 day old are considered for merging. Bulletins and identity records are never merged.
